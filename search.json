Marginalised themes - such as someone’s weight or ability - are often at the center of what’s being mocked or reflected on. - It is complete - This dataset provides enough observations (rows) to be able to surface interesting trends, and the majority of those rows have complete information for their columns. - It is available - Many of the other datasets we considered and found compelling are no longer available or have a high number of data protections making accessing them difficult, due to the sensitive themes of the data."

    "text": "Questions\nThe two central questions we’re looking to answer are: 1. What are the differences in distributions among social categories, marginalised groups, or themes represented in the jokes? - Can we see any patterns around what types of jokes are most prominent on each website?\n- Does the distribution suggest anything about the demographics on each site?\n2. How does each social category/theme relate to the scores and rating - are certain themes rated more highly? - What are the distributions of scores per theme? - Can we predict a joke’s rating based on its length and theme? - Is there major influence from certain users who are more active than others?"

    "section": "Analysis plan",
    "text": "Analysis plan\nWe’ll need to do some preprocessing on the data: - Convert JSON to CSV to add to a Google Sheet - Consider characters/symbols to remove, lowercasing, stop word removal, and other normalisation of the joke text - Create engineered features as new columns (using strict formulas, to start) - Find or create a stop word list - use to remove stop words from whole_text_normalised and whole_text_normalised_tokens - Come up with word lists for each theme; count how many times word is in the text (we may need to use a smarter approach than simply checking if a word is present, such as using an LLM to annotate themes)\nWe’ll likely need the following variables, engineered features, and additional data: - Counts/booleans for different social themes: gender, race, etc. - and word lists for each - theme_gender - women, men, nonbinary, agender, trans - theme_race - Black, white, Asian, racist - theme_sexuality - gay, homo, straight, sex, sexy, desire, arousal - theme_ability - weak, stupid, dumb, slow, disability, spelling, learning - theme_age - children, elders, old, young - theme_weight - fat, skinny, overweight - theme_appearance - ugly, blond, pimple - theme_class - poverty, poor - whole_text (string) - the first and second parts of the jokes combined - whole_text_normalised (string) - to support further NLP analysis - whole_text_normalised_tokens (list) - to support further NLP analysis - overall_length (int) - count of the words in the text (not normalised, stop words remain) - distinct_words (list) - the list of different words in the text (stop words removed) - distinct_words_count (int) - the number of different words used\nHow these will help us answer our questions: - Question 1: distributions of themes and representation - The social theme counts or booleans will allow us to see distributions per theme, which topics jokes most often reference - Question 2: relating themes to user ratings - We will be able to see and plot interesting stats (mean, median, standard deviation, etc) of the scores users typically assign per theme - Additional insights - We can also surface other relevant metrics and patterns using NLP strategies, such as observing which words are most commonly used in jokes, per theme, whether longer or shorter jokes are rated more highly, etc"
